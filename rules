📌 Rules for Linux Bible Notes (Saved in Memory)

1. 📖 Explain **only from your book**.  
   - No extra or irrelevant commands.  
   - Add Debian/Ubuntu equivalents only if book does not already mention them.  

2. ✍️ Use **simple English**.  
   - Short, clear, easy to understand sentences.  

3. ⌨️ Put **everything inside one code block**.  
   - No explanations outside.  

4. 🔹 Use **symbols/emojis**:  
   - 📂 files/folders  
   - 🌐 network/internet  
   - ⚡ performance/features  
   - ❌ removal/errors  
   - 📥 install/download  
   - 🔎 search/query  
   - 🔑 authentication/keys  
   - 🛠️ tools/commands  
   - 🕑 history/time  
   - 🔗 dependencies  

5. 🐧 **RHEL/Fedora vs Debian/Ubuntu rule**  
   - Book = RHEL/Fedora focus.  
   - If Debian equivalent missing → I must add it.  
   - If Debian already in book → don’t repeat it.  

6. 📦 Always explain **command options fully**.  
   - Example: `rpm -qi` → `-q` query, `-i` info.  

7. ⚖️ **Trimming rule**  
   - Less important chapters (like Linux installation) → only keep modern/useful parts.  
   - Important chapters (like package management, user management) → cover fully.  

8. 📂 Always include **file paths** mentioned in book.  
   - Example: `/etc/yum.conf`, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/login.defs`.  

9. ✅ **No final summary** anymore.  
   - End notes directly with explanations, no summary list.
